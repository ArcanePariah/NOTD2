DocInfo/DescShort=4+
DocInfo/HowToPlayAdvanced00=Distribute items and weapons fairly. Hogging them will only end up getting people killed.
DocInfo/HowToPlayAdvanced01=Completing missions will earn you much more experience than defeating enemies and sometimes earn you additional items.
DocInfo/HowToPlayAdvanced02=Weapons are situational. A SMG will mulch light enemies, but will be nearly useless against armored enemies.
DocInfo/HowToPlayAdvanced03=Making noise attracts the attention of the Infested. If you get too loud, they'll be able to pinpoint your location and swarm you.
DocInfo/HowToPlayAdvanced04=There's a possibility you will face enemies more dangerous and intelligent than the Infested. Be careful.
DocInfo/HowToPlayBasic00=Teamwork is key. United you are strong, but divided you will die.
DocInfo/HowToPlayBasic01=Supplies are limited, so try to avoid getting hit as much as possible.
DocInfo/HowToPlayBasic02=You've got a gun - use your range to your advantage and keep track of your ammunition.

Param/Value/040D4FF3=Chief Strassner
Param/Value/0A8C1626=Are you sure?
Param/Value/0C190CCA=Negative, but we've got dead fighters and civilians. There was definitely a battle here.
Param/Value/0C4BFE5B=Roger that.
Param/Value/0D484FC3=I see. We will notify Eden's HQ immediately.
Param/Value/0ED9585E=Excellent work, Argus. This will allow us to track radio communications and significant threats in Eden.
Param/Value/1715BF1F=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/18858747=Pilot
Param/Value/18C14E0F=Downloading "Demeter" files.
Param/Value/19E062E3=At least it's not a basement.
Param/Value/1B4C6413=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/1DF850AC=Poor dog had more than rabies.
Param/Value/1E5E31EF=Unfortunately, they have scattered due to some sort of interference, so you will have to sift through Eden to find them.
Param/Value/22B94A4F=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/232EFE87=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/256F026F=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/275241C9=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/28348C82=Argus, abandon your current task -- something more pressing has come up.
Param/Value/2929EB41=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/2C5E2A44=... I see your point.
Param/Value/2C880FC4=The entire eastern wing is dedicated to investigating the Apollo Incident, so I want you to search it and see if you can find anything useful.
Param/Value/2D37AE24=Argus, you have been reassigned as an investigative task force. We have air-dropped additional supplies into the colony to aid you.
Param/Value/2E901756=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/2FBCAFBD=We're going to remotely access the plant's systems and bring Eden back online.
Param/Value/308D9E51=Chief Strassner? They're dead. We didn't make it in time.
Param/Value/3115D03A=Hello again, friends!
Param/Value/3157DF40=Oh boy, cramped hallways. My favorite.
Param/Value/32614EEB=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/3540938B=Understood.
Param/Value/35604287=Chief Strassner
Param/Value/3640484C=We've also got some armor on the way. Should be arriving any second now.
Param/Value/36C94946=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/36D082AC=We'll take care of the non-cons you rounded up. You folks stay safe, you hear?
Param/Value/37E2A6A3=Hostiles incoming.
Param/Value/392B816B=Their throats have been torn out, ma'am. Two bodies, they seem to be laborers.
Param/Value/3C2E1404=Colonel Delania

Param/Value/3FE8B251=Open Frequency
Param/Value/42D93B1B=You folks land alright?
Param/Value/454AF384=Defend the plant, team. This is going to attract a lot of attention. If the reactor goes critical, Eden will be vaporized.
Param/Value/469F57A2=Oh, I see you brought some friends.
Param/Value/4C2EE41C=SSgt. Fenwick
Param/Value/4E05B011=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/4E9FE919=Is this the same thing that happened on Apollo?
Param/Value/4FD09351=Chief Strassner
Param/Value/50D98DF0=We understand.
Param/Value/51923A76=Thank you, sir. It's good to see people that aren't rotting.
Param/Value/51DAE582=It was a rough landing and we're scattered, but we're okay.

Param/Value/58980713=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/5E2D7AFA=Colonel Delania

Param/Value/60E642FE=Oh dear.
Param/Value/6181F3CF=Staff Sergeant Fenwick of the UGC Paratroopers, Mister Archangel.
Param/Value/6218C255=We are transmitting the access codes to the armory at the Military base.
Param/Value/629BAF57=Readouts indicate that the reactor is functional, but disconnected from the main grid.
Param/Value/63374128=Evacuate as soon as you can. We can't provide support of any kind when you're inside.
Param/Value/68A12B9D=Thank goodness you folks are here. I thought we were gone for sure.
Param/Value/6C8E7901=Roger that, ma'am.
Param/Value/6E013AD3=What a great idea to bring that shit here. Didn't we have to nearly destroy Apollo?
Param/Value/6E363C8B= Some kind of preservation. Sending image information now.
Param/Value/6E9C2011=I see you've managed to keep yourself alive! That is good.
Param/Value/719847FC=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/71BEDE61=Like bringing plutonium to a child's birthday party.
Param/Value/73768597=You must destroy it before it reaches maturity, or Eden will be doomed.
Param/Value/779EBF23=Deploy the Surveillance Arrays to track movement of hostiles in Eden.
Param/Value/79264110=Hey, plutonium is pretty cool.
Param/Value/79A71ED4=So much for guard duty. Now we've got Zombie Apocalypse duty.

Param/Value/7EE66995=Examine the bodies. What happened?
Param/Value/806B2518=Battalion, this place is a war zone.
Param/Value/8070BF33=Pilot
Param/Value/80C4BD30=Chief Strassner
Param/Value/82AD27D1=Argus, we've just been informed that you had to insert via Drop Pod. What's going on down there?
Param/Value/83D48F7E=We are pinned down at these coordinates. We need relief immediately!
Param/Value/83D66BEA=Copy that.
Param/Value/849D27AF=Thankfully, you will not have to do it alone.
Param/Value/8520B6E3=Get to those people, team. I'm arranging an extraction now.
Param/Value/86D55CDE=Contact?

Param/Value/963E86B2=Chief Strassner
Param/Value/970E374B=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/97CDCE00=That's what I thought. Eden has been running on back-up systems.
Param/Value/99BA8395=Looks like. What do you think causes something like this?
Param/Value/99F1B67C=SSgt. Fenwick
Param/Value/9C18A9E1=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/9FC733C0=Less talking, more shooting!
Param/Value/A00EA8CC=Yes ma'am.
Param/Value/A34E806D=This infection is creating monsters!
Param/Value/A40610C9=We've done it.
Param/Value/A57C5CF0=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/A6A19592=Torn apart. They look like they were cut open and... eaten?
Param/Value/A7A33875=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/A7B92638=Could have been worse.
Param/Value/A80939C8=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/A8C1C70A=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/AA9232CB=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/AAA8DF4E= It's also extremely dangerous and will kill you if you handle it wrong.
Param/Value/AB2715AF=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/ACC6F38E=Military HQ
Param/Value/AD61331E=Ah. There we are. Well, shall we?
Param/Value/B10F482E=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/B26871EF=Whatever it was that they had locked up, it didn't want to be here anymore.
Param/Value/B3206B88=Reactor
Param/Value/B33EB1B1=Gather ammunition from the fighters. Stand next to a body or container to search it for items.
Param/Value/B5074E42=SSgt. Fenwick
Param/Value/B5F9E978=Don't invite disaster, please.
Param/Value/B9825995=Argus, we've just picked up something large that is closing in on you rapidly.
Param/Value/BA428501=Head up the road a bit and check in with HQ. They'll be happy to see you.
Param/Value/BB21F111=There are five surveillance arrays in the armory. Set them up at these locations.
Param/Value/BC6D33C5=Cut the chatter. Flashlights, everyone.
Param/Value/BD0F3C99=It would've been rougher if I had crashed this thing. You folks stay safe.
Param/Value/BDDE9DF1=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/C1B6F01B=Chief Strassner
Param/Value/C1C6FA51=I... I see.
Param/Value/C28ED0EE=That's the ammunition modifier formula developed to counteract the infestation. We'll get some to you as quickly as possible.
Param/Value/C3056A6D=Deploy Surveillance Arrays
Param/Value/C4011AB4=We can't move these people until we have a ride out. We need you to get them while we keep these people safe.
Param/Value/C415AE91=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/C51FFE2D=We're at the plant, ma'am.
Param/Value/C5CEAF44=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/C680DD11=Security footage indicates that the source of the outbreak was in the research facility north of Eden.
Param/Value/C69186AD=You'd think with Eden being so important they'd invest in lights that don't suck.
Param/Value/C77B184E=Your ride home is on its way, Argus. Good work.
Param/Value/C9CB0A85=Off you go. Enjoy your guard duty.
Param/Value/CA4C016F=We have an evac prepped for your civilians. It will arrive shortly at these coordinates.
Param/Value/CB072A86=Maybe they're not finished yet?
Param/Value/CB48FA82=How does that not appeal to you?
Param/Value/CC08032B=There are four surveillance arrays in the armory. Set them up at these locations.
Param/Value/CC2B6753=Howdy, Argus. Heard you had some folks that needed a ride on our bird.
Param/Value/CC55861B=Chief Strassner
Param/Value/CD48BFA7=Don't have to tell me twice!
Param/Value/CFC93932=Some information would be nice!
Param/Value/D18D17B9=Eden HQ isn't responding. Something isn't right here. Be alert.
Param/Value/D420BDED=I just got a message from one of my Sergeants -- he's got some civilians hiding in the city.
Param/Value/D7D4F0E9=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/D8AF1F57=Check the Customs Lockup area for supplies as well. It sounds like you'll need them.
Param/Value/DA363574=SSgt. Fenwick
Param/Value/DA624995=The blueprints show a storage area and a firing range for weapons testing deeper in the facility. I doubt you will find any information there, but you may find some equipment you can use.
Param/Value/DABE8983=Sgt. Ascalon
Param/Value/DAC146F8=Aww, see? The brass does care. It's an early Christmas!
Param/Value/DBBFB2E1=What looks to be the apex of the infestation has emerged from the caves, but it doesn't look like it's complete yet.
Param/Value/DC0EB3E1=SSgt. Fenwick
Param/Value/DC746DF6=Investigate Eden's power plant and report any abnormalities.
Param/Value/DF5C8F23=Chief Strassner
Param/Value/E03D4BEF=Downloading the data now.
Param/Value/E10CE0BB=Chief Strassner of the Eden Peacekeepers. There's been some kind of illness making people go mad and turn to cannibals.
Param/Value/E366C9FD=These cabinets should have something we can use.
Param/Value/E370D9C2=UGC! Come with us!
Param/Value/E715EBB1=Pilot
Param/Value/E76D5DB5=These civilians still need help. Get back here as soon as you can.
Param/Value/E93C9795=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/EA06FC91=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/EB20F580=We've found some sort of chemical formula.
Param/Value/EB53A4B8=Barely a light on in the city, ma'am. There were no suitable landing areas for the transport.
Param/Value/EB653B7D=Armory
Param/Value/ED4452C4=Oh hey, I've heard of him. They call him the Archangel of Eden.
Param/Value/EE1D2C6F=We're picking up a lot of movement from the cave system below Eden, team. Be alert.
Param/Value/EE7BAF6C=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/EE9D6700= Seems like that was most of them.
Param/Value/EE9E7972=We'll try.
Param/Value/F487A5A5=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/F55E45F0=Colonel Delania
Param/Value/F9333D6F=Chief Strassner has informed us that the current outbreak began several hours after there was a colony-wide power failure.
