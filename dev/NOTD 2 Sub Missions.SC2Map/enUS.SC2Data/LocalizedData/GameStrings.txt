DocInfo/DescShort=4+
DocInfo/HowToPlayAdvanced00=Distribute items and weapons fairly. Hogging them will only end up getting people killed.
DocInfo/HowToPlayAdvanced01=Completing missions will earn you much more experience than defeating enemies and sometimes earn you additional items.
DocInfo/HowToPlayAdvanced02=Weapons are situational. A SMG will mulch light enemies, but will be nearly useless against armored enemies.
DocInfo/HowToPlayAdvanced03=Making noise attracts the attention of the Infested. If you get too loud, they'll be able to pinpoint your location and swarm you.
DocInfo/HowToPlayAdvanced04=There's a possibility you will face enemies more dangerous and intelligent than the Infested. Be careful.
DocInfo/HowToPlayBasic00=Teamwork is key. United you are strong, but divided you will die.
DocInfo/HowToPlayBasic01=Supplies are limited, so try to avoid getting hit as much as possible.
DocInfo/HowToPlayBasic02=You've got a gun - use your range to your advantage and keep track of your ammunition.
DocInfo/HowToPlayWinning00=NOTD 2 is a survival game, so succeeding means survival. The longer you survive, the more rewards you will earn.
