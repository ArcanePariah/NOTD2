UserData/TalentTrees/Rifleman_Headers_001=Survival
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Field Assistance Tree_Header=Support
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Field Assistance Tree_Talent Tooltips=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">First Aid</s><n/><n/>By applying a steady stream of nanites programmed to repair damaged tissue and act as temporary oxygen carriers, the Medic is capable of healing wounded allies. The Medic also has access to nanites with a subroutine that exhumes non-native toxins from the body, effectively countering any poisons or venoms that the patient may have been inflicted with.<n/><n/>Level 1: Heal restores 4 hitpoints per second, Antivenom’s cooldown is 15 seconds<n/>Level 2: Heal restores 6 hitpoints per second, Antivenom’s cooldown is 10 seconds<n/>Level 3: Heal restores 8 hitpoints per second, Antivenom’s cooldown is 5 seconds<n/><n/>“First Aid is the initial care for an illness or injury and is usually performed by trained personnel to a sick or injured person until expert medical treatment can be provided.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Field Assistance Tree_Talent Tooltips_001=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Nano-Haste</s><n/><n/>Nanite injections have replaced most performance-enhancing drugs to reduce potential dependence and other negative side effects while still retaining many of the positive effects commonly associated with such substances. The “Haste” packet mimics a rush of adrenaline, providing a measured burst of energy to the target that allows them to operate at a higher pace.<n/><n/>Level 1: Increases movement and attack speed by 10% for 40 seconds. 60 second cooldown.<n/>Level 2: Increases movement and attack speed by 15% for 50 seconds. 50 second cooldown.<n/>Level 3: Increases movement and attack speed by 20% for 60 seconds. 40 second cooldown.<n/><n/>“Gotta go fast!”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Field Assistance Tree_Talent Tooltips_002=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Medical Expertise</s><n/><n/><c val="FFFF80">Passive</c><n/><n/>The Medic is able to modify their nanites to produce additional effects, such as mending ruptured skin to seal open wounds and integrating a bone mending routine into the Haste packet. Weave nanites are also capable of repairing fractures and exhuming toxins from the body, but this requires a specific modification from a trained operator, as inexact application can lead to drastically worsening injuries or irregular bone growth.<n/><n/>Level 1: Heal cures Open Wounds over time and Haste cures bone damage over time.<n/>Level 2: The energy cost of Antivenom is reduced by 50% and Weave cures random ailments over time.<n/><n/>“Trust me, I’m a doctor.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Field Assistance Tree_Talent Tooltips_003=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Nano-Weave</s><n/><n/>A “Weave” nanite is smarter and more robust variant of the standard “Heal” nanite, sporting more processing power and a longer operational window. It is capable of searching out wounded tissue and repairing it without supervision, allowing the user to focus on other tasks or patients.<n/><n/>Level 1: Restores 5 hitpoints per second for 15 seconds.<n/>Level 2: Restores 8 hitpoints per second for 15 seconds.<n/><n/>“Take this and call me in the morning.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Field Assistance Tree_Talent Tooltips_004=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Nano-Shield</s><n/><n/>The “Shield” nanite functions by attaching itself to the targets’ clothing and networking with the other Shield nanites present. This creates a latticework of energy that functions as a force field, shielding them from outside harm. When used on someone wearing powered armor, the energy is routed directly into the armor’s shield generator, restoring it to maximum operational capacity and providing additional shield strength for a short time.<n/><n/>Level 1: Boosts the shields of all units in a 2.5 radius, fully restoring them and granting 75 bonus shields and 4 shield armor for 30 seconds.<n/><n/>“Behold! The Impregnabubble!”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Field Assistance Tree_Talent Tooltips_005=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Nano-Strength</s><n/><n/>Like the “Haste” nanite, the “Strength” nanite is designed to replicate the positive effects of performance-enhancing drugs without the negative effects. The “Strength” nanite provides short-term cognitive and muscular enhancements by mimicking anti-anxiety medication and a handful of other performance-enhancing substances. It decreases reaction time and increases physical strength, making snap decisions easier to make and weapon weight and recoil easier to handle for a brief period.<n/><n/>Level 1: Increases the target’s ranged damage and turn speed by 50% and their melee damage by 100% for 60 seconds.<n/><n/>“RIP AND TEAR YOUR GUTS!”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Nano Tree_Header=Nano
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Nano Tree_Talent Tooltips=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Nano-Shock</s><n/><n/>Medics in combat often utilize their nanites as weapons, turning them into dangerous tools by intentionally instructing them to bring harm to others rather than heal them. The most common of these combat modifications is the “Shock”, a nanite operation that produces muscle spasms so violent that they often cause ruptured arteries and internal bleeding.<n/><n/>Level 1: Deals 50 damage and slows units by 45% for 1 second.<n/>Level 2: Deals 100 damage and slows units by 45% for 2 seconds.<n/>Level 3: Deals 150 damage and slows units by 45% for 3 seconds.<n/><n/>“Nanites, like any medical tool, can kill people. It is your job to make sure that they don’t… unless you want them to.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Nano Tree_Talent Tooltips_001=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Volatile Injection</s><n/><n/>Actually a dart injection rather than a syringe, nanites enter the victim’s body and proceed to the stomach where they begin producing volatile gas and modifying the victim’s stomach acid to dangerous levels. Upon the victim’s death, the nanites will self-destruct, igniting the gas and causing the body to explode and spray the powerful acid everywhere, maiming and possibly killing nearby targets.<n/><n/>Level 1: Deals 100 damage to nearby units on target death.<n/>Level 2: Deals 150 damage to nearby units on target death.<n/>Level 3: Deals 200 damage to nearby units on target death.<n/><n/>“Normally people don’t screw with us ‘cause we’re non-combatants. Don’t shoot the Medic, right? Well, some people did anyways, and let’s just say those people and everyone around them met an untimely end. Now they’re too afraid to shoot us, ‘cause we shoot back with these.” 
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Nano Tree_Talent Tooltips_002=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Aftershock</s><n/><n/>“Shock” nanites have a much longer operational capacity than most nanites due to their destructive implementation being less stressful on their processors than the careful finesse required to repair damaged tissue. It was recently discovered that they linger in their victim’s body after the original attack is complete, allowing a skilled operator to re-activate them and attack their targets once more from within, causing in even more trauma.<n/><n/>Level 1: Aftershock deals Nano-Shock’s current level in damage and stuns the target for 1 second if it is under Nano-Shock’s slow effect.<n/>Level 2: Reduces cooldown and increases stun duration.<n/><n/>“I like to believe that the first person that experienced the Aftershock technique was thinking “I’m glad that’s over” after the initial hit. I can only imagine their disappointment.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Nano Tree_Talent Tooltips_003=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Intolerable Cruelty</s><n/><n/><c val="FFFF80">Passive</c><n/><n/>Volatile Injection’s nanites can be modified to damage the stomach lining of the victim and spread themselves throughout the body, using tissue as fuel to more rapidly produce gas and increase the acidity of the stomach’s fluid.<n/><n/>Level 1: Increases the burst radius of Volatile Injection to 3 and causes units under the effect of Volatile Injection to take 3 damage per second for 30 seconds.<n/>Level 2: Increases the burst radius of Volatile Injection to 4 and causes units under the effect of Volatile Injection to take 6 damage per second for 30 seconds.<n/><n/>“I’ve never vomited myself to death before. I imagine it’s unpleasant.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Nano Tree_Talent Tooltips_004=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Nano-Sear</s><n/><n/>An enormous swarm of nanites is released to an area, attacking and tearing apart anything that comes within range. Despite primarily being designed to work on biological targets, it is notably effective against mechanical targets and shields.<n/><n/>Level 1: Creates a cloud at the target location that applies a damage over time effect that deals 15 damage per second for 60 seconds to all units that pass through it. Units that remain within the cloud take double damage from the damage over time effect and have their movespeed reduced by 10% every 5 seconds up to 50%. The movespeed reduction fades as soon as the unit leaves the cloud.<n/><n/>“It’s like having a No-Man’s-Land in your pocket, ‘cause anyone that walks in that cloud isn’t coming out.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Medic Nano Tree_Talent Tooltips_005=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Nano-Plague</s><n/><n/>What has become known as the “Nano-Plague” program was actually originally intended for industrial construction to weaken key points in buildings so their demolition would proceed smoothly. However, it was discovered that medical nanites could be loaded with the program, making it an incredibly dangerous weapon that will disassemble its target from the inside out.<n/><n/>Level 1: Deals 40 damage per second for 90 seconds and reduces the target’s armor by 5. If the target dies while under the effects of Volatile Injection, Nano-Plague will be applied to all units damaged by Volatile Injection’s burst.<n/><n/>“Seeing your buddy literally melt into a puddle can’t be good for morale. Oh well. They shouldn’t have shot at us.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Combat Tree_Header=Combat
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Combat Tree_Talent Tooltips=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Critical Strike</s><n/><n/><c val="FFFF80">Passive</c><n/><n/>The Rifleman has remarkable accuracy with most weapons, allowing them to strike at targets of opportunity at an increased rate. Critical damage varies based on the weapon being used.<n/><n/>Level 1: 10% chance to deal bonus damage.<n/>Level 2: 20% chance to deal bonus damage.<n/>Level 3: 30% chance to deal bonus damage.<n/><n/>“My rifle and I know that what counts in this war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit...”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Combat Tree_Talent Tooltips_001=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Fire Up</s><n/><n/><c val="FFFF80">Passive</c><n/><n/>The thrill of combat brings the Rifleman into a higher state of focus, providing additional offensive bonuses when using Focus Fire.<n/><n/>Level 1: Increases attack speed by 15% and range by 1 while using Focus Fire.<n/>Level 2: Increases attack speed by 30% and range by 2 while using Focus Fire.<n/>Level 3: Increases attack speed by 45% and range by 3 while using Focus Fire.<n/><n/>“This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Combat Tree_Talent Tooltips_002=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Weapon Proficiency</s><n/><n/><c val="FFFF80">Passive</c><n/><n/>Constant weapons drills have turned reloading weapons and absorbing their recoil into an act of muscle memory, making the Rifleman much more proficient at handling weapons.<n/><n/>Level 1: Increases reload speed by 15% and increases Focus Fire damage by 5%.<n/>Level 2: Increases reload speed by 30% and increases Focus Fire damage by 10%.<n/><n/>“My rifle is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will keep my rifle clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Combat Tree_Talent Tooltips_003=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Fragmentation Grenade</s><n/><n/>Fragmentation Grenades are anti-personnel weapons that are designed to scatter shrapnel at high velocities upon detonation, wounding and potentially killing targets in a fairly large area. Because they rely on fragmented metal rather than the concussive strength of the grenade itself, these weapons have a fairly large radius of effect, but perform very poorly against armor and do almost nothing against shields. Grenades are affected by Critical Strike and Focus Fire’s damage bonus.<n/><n/>Level 1: Deals 100 damage to enemies in a radius of 2 with a travel time of 1.5 seconds. Damage is reduced by 50% against Armored units and 95% against shields.<n/>Level 2: Deals 200 damage to enemies in a radius of 3 with a travel time of 1.5 seconds. Damage is reduced by 50% against Armored units and 95% against shields.<n/><n/>“‘Almost’ counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. Thankfully, what you’re holding isn’t a horseshoe.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Combat Tree_Talent Tooltips_004=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Bloodlust</s><n/><n/>Intoxicated by the rush of battle and slaying their enemies, the Rifleman enters a state of heightened reflexes and zeal and shoots with pinpoint accuracy for a brief period of time.<n/><n/>Level 1: The Rifleman receives 50% bonus attack speed and damage for 15 seconds.<n/><n/>“I happen to be a death-dealing, blood-crazed warrior who wakes up every day just hoping for the chance to dismember my enemies and defile their civilizations.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Combat Tree_Talent Tooltips_005=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Grenadier</s><n/><n/><c val="FFFF80">Passive</c><n/><n/>The UGC Modular Grenade Launcher is an underslung grenade launcher weapon attachment that can be applied instantly to nearly any weapon. In the event of the weapon being incompatible, it can also be used alone. Grenade launchers are weapons that fire grenades with more accuracy, velocity, and range than a user could throw them. The UGC MGL uses an electromagnetic catapult mechanism rather than a firing assembly, allowing it to use both hand grenades and launcher grenades as ammunition. Grenades are affected by Focus Fire’s damage bonus and can Critical Strike.<n/><n/>Level 1: Fragmentation Grenade gains additional range and damage if it is Level 2 and the Rifleman gains access to the Impaler Grenade and Plasma Grenade abilities.<n/><n/>“Reach out and blow up someone.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Survival Tree_Header=Survival
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Survival Tree_Talent Tooltips=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Crippling Fire</s><n/><n/><c val="FFFF80">Passive</c><n/><n/>Defensive combat training allows the Rifleman to effectively utilize suppressing action during Focus Fire, providing additional defensive bonuses when using Focus Fire.<n/><n/>Level 1: Lowers the attacked target’s movespeed by 15% and attack speed by 5% for 1 second.<n/>Level 2: Lowers the attacked target’s movespeed by 20% and attack speed by 10% for 1 second.<n/>Level 3: Lowers the attacked target’s movespeed by 25% and attack speed by 15% for 1 second.<n/><n/>“Sometimes, looking to incapacitate the enemy rather than kill them is the better option. Ethically? You should always shoot to wound. However, in this case, doing the right thing also has a tactical advantage: it takes two men to remove a wounded ally, but it takes zero to leave a dead one behind. Making injured rather than dead presents more opportunities for you and your squad to be useful.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Survival Tree_Talent Tooltips_001=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Precision Shot</s><n/><n/>The Rifleman takes aim and fires a single well placed shot at the enemy, dealing high damage and slowing them. The target takes 50% additional damage if it is slowed or stunned. Precision Shot is affected by Focus Fire’s damage bonus and can Critical strike. If Focus Fire is active and has Crippling Strike’s upgrade, the bonus damage is applied automatically.<n/><n/>Level 1: Deals 100 damage and slows target movespeed by 10% for 5 seconds.<n/>Level 2: Deals 200 damage and slows target movespeed by 20% for 5 seconds.<n/>Level 3: Deals 300 damage and slows target movespeed by 40% for 5 seconds.<n/><n/>“My rifle, without me, is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will...”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Survival Tree_Talent Tooltips_002=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Self Aid</s><n/><n/>The Rifleman has been instructed in basic medical training, allowing them to treat most injuries that they may incur during active duty. The Rifleman’s powered exoskeleton also has a multitude of integrated injection modules which contain various antivenoms, coagulants, and saline. If the suit is in overdrive, it is even possible to set bones and mend fractures nearly instantly.<n/><n/>Level 1: Restores 30 hitpoints and cures 1 Venom.<n/>Level 2: Restores 60 hitpoints and cures 1 Venom and 1 Open Wound.<n/><n/>“The easiest way to stay alive is to stay healthy. It’s never “just a scratch” – treat every wound with the respect it deserves.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Survival Tree_Talent Tooltips_003=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Sonic Trap</s><n/><n/>A Sonic Trap is a device about the size of a briefcase that suspends 6 explosive charges inside an energy field. When a non-authorized entity draws near the device, one of the charges explodes, causing the energy field to expand rapidly in an attempt to contain the reaction. This creates a large non-lethal shockwave that is capable of pushing objects up to 250 pounds away without causing significant harm. Sonic Traps are popular with both security and military forces, as they can be used indiscriminately to disable insurgents or otherwise hostile forces without significant harm to civilians or property.<n/><n/>Level 1: When an enemy passes within 3 radius, all non-heroic and non-massive units in a 5 radius are pushed back a distance of 5 and stunned for 0.5 seconds. Massive units are slowed by 20% and Heroic units are slowed by 10%.<n/>Level 2: When an enemy passes within 3 radius, all non-heroic and non-massive units in a 8 radius are pushed back a distance of 5 and stunned for 1 second. Massive units are slowed by 40% and Heroic units are slowed by 20%.<n/><n/>“These things used to be way louder - it’s how they got their name, ‘cause they sounded like a sonic boom coming from a jet. Nowadays though, they’re all quiet when they throw you fifty friggin' feet.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Survival Tree_Talent Tooltips_004=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">Repulse</s><n/><n/>The Rifleman forces an enormous surge of energy into their suit’s capacitors and shields, accelerating their suit’s systems to overdrive and blasting the excess from its shield nodes in a searing flash of light and heat. This state of overdrive improves the suit’s basic functions for a brief time, increasing the defensive benefits provided by the exoskeleton considerably.<n/><n/>Level 1: Non-Heroic units in a radius of 6 take 200 damage and are stunned for 5 seconds. Heroic units have their movement speed lowered by 50% for 5 seconds. The Rifleman gains 2 armor, 50% bonus movement speed, and an improved Self Aid for 10 seconds.<n/><n/>“Your armor, not unlike a shield, is not just something that protects you. Used properly, it is also an effective weapon.”
UserData/UnknownUserType/Rifleman Survival Tree_Talent Tooltips_005=<s val="HeaderExtendedTemplate">K-9</s><n/><n/>Dogs have been used as companions in wartime situations for thousands of years and for a wide variety of uses. Most commonly, they are employed as sentries, scouts, and combat companions. Animal rights lobbyists (along with recent infestation fears) have generally phased out live combat companions, but the recent surge in robotics funding and research has provided a replacement that addresses both concerns.<n/><n/>Level 1: The K-9 Unit is a versatile companion that can be used to aid in combat, scout, retrieve items, and defend areas.<n/><n/>“Man’s best friend isn’t a dog anymore. It’s a dog shaped robot buddy.”
