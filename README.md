Starcraft 2 Custom Map

Setup Instructions

1)  Install Starcraft II. It can be downloaded for free with the Battle.net Desktop Application.

2)  Clone the repository into the Mods folder in the Starcraft 2 installation directory (Starcraft II/Mods). The development files use
    local dependencies, not the ones online.
    
Build Instructions

1)  In general, you will not need to build, because the test docuement will work with unpacked SC2Mod and SC2Map files. However, if you wish to do so
    simply run Build Script.cmd. This is a Windows Command Script, since the SC2 Editor is a windows only program. I will refine the script to build data and
    assets seperately.
