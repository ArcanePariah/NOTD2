 - Repurpose current enemy AI into two factions - one for Ambients and one for Hordes. Naturally, they are allied to one another, and hostile to everyone else.
 - Ambient AI handles Ambients and nothing else. Current wandering/grouping behavior is perfect.
 - Horde AI will be a straightforward "attackattackattack" AI except in special circumstances and units, which can be handled with validators/triggers/ect.
 - Horde AI will handle bosses.
 - Spawners themselves will be split into one for each category of unit type - so Ambients will get their own, Heavies will get their own, Suicides will get their own, ect.
 - What units the Spawners have access to will be determined by Upgrades (aka X unit requires Y upgrade). This is to make sure my stupid ass can easily alter things later, be it making difficulty changes or adding to the enemy roster.
 - Horde Spawners should be placed in the same locations as the Ambient Spawners.
 - Horde Spawners require Power (supplied by an invisible and invulnerable Pylon, or a knockoff of Karax's Power Field, or something) to be active. Ambient Spawners do not.
 - Horde events are handled by powering the Horde Spawners. How many become active at one time is determined by difficulty. (1 for recruit, 2 for vet, global for nm)
